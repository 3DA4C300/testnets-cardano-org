## Cardano and Plutus

Plutus Playground, a testbed for Plutus, is now ready and in the coming months it will be fully integrated with the Cardano testnet. Then you will be able to deploy contracts that you write in the Playground to the blockchain settlement layer of Cardano itself. Contracts that you develop in the Plutus Playground use the same programming language and library interfaces as those that are deployed to the Cardano mainnet.
