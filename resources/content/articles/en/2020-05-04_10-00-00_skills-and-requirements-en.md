## IELE Skill Set

As an experienced blockchain developer, you are familiar with writing smart contracts in Solidity and have an understanding of the build tool Truffle. You should be familiar with an integrated development environment such as Remix and comfortable with wallets in the command line, like Mallet. Familiarity with higher-level languages such as Java and JavaScript is desirable and knowledge of the JSON remote procedure call (RPC) protocol is recommended.

For testing purposes, you will need a suite of well-defined smart contracts to use on the IELE testnet. Before you can run your smart contracts on the testnet, you will need to collect test tokens from the [IELE Faucet](/en/more/iele/tools/faucet/). Please note there is no registration required to use the testnet.

In case you need a refresher on using Remix or smart contracts in general, go through the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts). This is sufficient for you to be able to use the IELE testnet.
