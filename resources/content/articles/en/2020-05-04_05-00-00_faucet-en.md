## Faucet

You can access the testnet faucet using the form below, where you must enter a wallet address to receive the testnet funds.

Follow these instructions to get testnet tokens from the faucet:
1. Enter the address you want tokens sent to in the field below.
1. Click 'Request'.
1. Wait for funds to be accessible. This usually takes 5-10 minutes.

When you have finished using your testnet tokens, please return them to the faucet so that other members of the community can use them. Tokens should be returned to this address: **ca1s44h5hytev8d9wty220ckglvj7ewm3yetyug8a29pu2lj5dff28sy2yf8yj
