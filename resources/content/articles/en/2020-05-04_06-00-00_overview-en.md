## Overview

The Plutus Platform is a smart contract development platform for Cardano. It features a Haskell SDK that allows developers to write high-assurance applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain.

Weâ€™re currently in the process of updating all our Plutus documentation and migrating it to a brand new home. Meanwhile, for a useful overview please enjoy this video with Michael Peyton-Jones from #Cardano2020 virtual summit, which took place in early July.
