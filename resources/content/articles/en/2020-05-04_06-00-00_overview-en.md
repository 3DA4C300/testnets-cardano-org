## Overview

Plutus provides an execution platform and functional programming language that runs on the Cardano settlement layer and provides considerable security advantages. It delivers an easier, more robust way to show that your smart contracts are correct and will not encounter the problems found in previous smart contract language design. By using Plutus you can be confident in the correct execution of your smart contracts. It has been designed with three major audiences in mind: developers, business experts, and academia.

Plutus is embedded in Haskell, is familiar to Haskell programmers, while being easier to analyse than Haskell itself.
