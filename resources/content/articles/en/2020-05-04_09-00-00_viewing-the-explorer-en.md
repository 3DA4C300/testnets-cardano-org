## Viewing the explorer

### The Byron testnet block explorer

The testnet provides a [block explorer](https://explorer.cardano-testnet.iohkdev.io/). This tool displays information about activity on the blockchain. The block explorer shows transaction history and other details, making it easy for users to find information about the cryptocurrency. In particular, it shows the latest blocks in the chain as well as identifying the first block in the chain. It can also display the last blocks mined.
