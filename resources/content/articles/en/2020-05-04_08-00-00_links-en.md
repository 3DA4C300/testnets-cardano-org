The following resources about Marlowe are available:

### [Marlowe in Cardano explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S41GIRl0kVY&t=14s)

Sebastien Guillemot from Emurgo gives a video introduction to the original Marlowe paper.

### [Marlowe: financial contracts on blockchains](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#marlowe-financial-contracts-on-blockchain)

This paper explores the design of Marlowe and the execution of financial contracts on blockchains. It presents an executable semantics of Marlowe in Haskell, an example of Marlowe in practice, and describes the web-based Meadow tool for interacting with simulations of Marlowe contracts.
