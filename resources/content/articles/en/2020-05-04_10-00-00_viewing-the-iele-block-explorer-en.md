## Viewing the IELE Block Explorer

The IELE testnet provides a [block explorer](https://iele-testnet.iohkdev.io/). This is a useful tool that displays information about activity on the blockchain. The block explorer shows transaction history and other details, making it easy for users to find information about the cryptocurrency. Importantly, it shows the latest blocks in the chain as well as identifying the first block in the chain. It displays the last blocks mined.

You can search for specific transactions, addresses or block numbers and will get back the details of that operation.

### Checking the status of the testnet

A very useful feature of the explorer is that you can check the status of the blockchain to see if it’s up and mining. After all this is a testnet and continuous updates in the software are expected. In explorer, simply click on the Status link and you’ll get the status of the testnet.
