## Skills and requirements

As a developer who wants to learn Plutus, you will typically have a working knowledge of Haskell, but this does not have to be extensive. If you want to learn more about Haskell, we recommend the [Learning Haskell tutorial](http://tutorial.learninghaskell.com) and the comprehensive [Haskell Programming book](http://haskellbook.com). For those of you who want to delve deeper into Haskell, you can learn more using the in-depth [guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com). 

A general understanding of smart contracts would be useful to learn about and work with Plutus, but is not essential for starting out.
