## Support & Feedback

Thank you for your interest in building native tokens on Cardano. To help you get started, we have compiled a useful list of resources:

* [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-tokens/150)
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)

Note that over the holiday period, technical support for the pre-production environment and token builder tool will be *extremely* limited.

Support will be unavailable between the dates of 23rd - 27th December and 31 December - 3rd January, both inclusive.

Outside these hours, our technical and community teams will occasionally check in on the [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) and dedicated [Cardano Forum discussion] (https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-tokens/150), to expedite any urgent queries or requests.

We encourage you to draw on community feedback and support as much as possible.
