## Support & Feedback

Thanks for your interest in building native tokens on Cardano. To help you get started we have compiled a handy list of resources:

* [Cardano Forum discussion forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-tokens/150)
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)

Please note that over the holiday period, technical support for the pre-production environment and token builder tool will be extremely limited.

Support is unavailable between the dates of 23rd - 27th December and 31 December - 3rd January inclusive.

Outside these hours, our technical and community teams will be periodically checking in on the [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) and dedicated [Cardano Forum discussion] (https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-tokens/150), to expedite any urgent queries or requests.

We encourage you to draw on community feedback and support as much as possible.
