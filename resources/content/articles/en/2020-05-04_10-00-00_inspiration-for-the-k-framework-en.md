## Inspiration for the K framework

<!-- embed youtube/6utib2mqEIM -->

In this video, Grigore Rosu, professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and chief executive of Runtime Verification, talks about the inspiration behind his work and research. Vital to this is the influence that his PhD supervisor, Joseph Goguen, has had on his life, mathematics and the K framework. He has been working with IOHK since June 2017 to develop technology based on formal semantics for Cardano, including KEVM and IELE virtual machines.
