## IELE architecture

Understanding the driving forces in the design of IELE can be useful as you deploy and interact with your smart contracts. IELE is modelled on [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) and follows a semantics-based approach to deliver a more secure, more reliable platform that gives developers an easier way to verify their smart contracts.

More detailed information about the design of IELE is available here.
