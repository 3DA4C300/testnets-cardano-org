## Overview

Glow is a new domain specific language (DSL) for developing decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain. With Glow, you can write secure dApps and be assured that your smart contracts can run safely in an adversarial environment. Glow is the brainchild of [Mukn](https://mukn.io), a valued community partner within the Cadano ecosystem. 

Glow is a language to develop not just a smart contract, but an entire dApp itself, which also includes client code and formal proofs. It is backed by formal methods that are intrinsically built into the language and its actual implementation. It is this inherent correctness of the language that means the code will perform as expected and the dApp will behave as users want (so users do not have their transactions blocked or their assets locked). 

Additionally, the Glow compiler generates matching client code, and a logical model of your dApp, so you can actually prove that it is correct prior to deploying it. From a single Glow specification, the compiler will generate matching code for both the dApp client and the smart contract itself. The runtime component tracks the code versions to ensure you are always using the correct, matching, and trusted versions of both the client and smart contract. Finally, since correctness is such a priority for dApps, Glow helps you specify a logical model of your dApp, so you can formally verify that it is indeed correct.

We are currently working on additional documentation to support our integration with Glow, and explain exactly how you can use and interact with this language. Weâ€™ll be expanding these pages over the weeks and months ahead; [take our short survey](https://input-output.typeform.com/c/OJsf0XcD) to be kept informed of all the latest updates.
