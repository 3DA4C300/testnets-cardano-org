## Overview

The Cardano testnet gives you the opportunity to test Shelley functionality, including stake pools, stake delegation, and decentralization, before these features are deployed on the Cardano mainnet. The goal of the testnet is to provide stake pool operators with a chance to actively test the core Shelley functionality and prepare for running stake pools on the Cardano mainnet. So, do give us your feedback and offer your suggestions about improvements or enhancements you would like to see in future and help us deliver a best-in-class experience on the Shelley mainnet.
