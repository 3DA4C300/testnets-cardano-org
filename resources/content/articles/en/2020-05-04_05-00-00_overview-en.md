## Overview

The Cardano testnet is the final step before [Shelley era functionality](https://cardanoroadmap.com/en/shelley/), including stake pools, stake delegation, and decentralization, is rolled out to the Cardano mainnet. Following the [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/), which saw the initial deployment of Shelley-ready infrastructure and nodes on mainnet, this testnet is an opportunity to hone the finer details of the Shelley implementation, as well as allowing stake pool operators to prepare for running their stake pool on the mainnet. The goal of the testnet is to provide stake pool operators with a chance to actively test the core Shelley functionality, and submit their feedback. This testing and feedback will help us deliver a best-in-class experience on the Shelley mainnet.
