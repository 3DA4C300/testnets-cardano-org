## Coding in IELE Assembly

<!-- embed youtube/Gi4Zrvu3bVE -->

On Mallet 2.0, apart from compiling Solidity code, you can also compile IELE assembly language directly. This is helpful if you want to optimize the compiled smart contract by hand.

In the video above, Lars Br√ºnjes demonstrates how to:

* Compile a Solidity smart contract to IELE assembly.
* Optimize IELE assembly.
* Compile the optimized assembly.
