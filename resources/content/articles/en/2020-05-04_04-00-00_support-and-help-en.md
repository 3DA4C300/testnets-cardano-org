## Support and help

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano and the testnet. We have an active [Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial) channel and a [technical support desk](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002392053-Shelley-Incentivized-Testnet) to help with the process.

### Telegam channel: Cardano developers

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just join the [@CardanoDevelopersOfficial](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial) channel.

### How to get technical support

To contact IOHK Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
You can also click the Support button at the bottom right of your 
screen. The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
