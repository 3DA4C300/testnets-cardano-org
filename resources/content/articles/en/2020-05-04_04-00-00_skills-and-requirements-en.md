## Skills and requirements for stake pool operators

Stake pools will be a key part of a decentralized Cardano, supporting the incentivization mechanisms that ensure the long-term health and liveness of the network. By running a stake pool, stake pool operators enable other users to delegate their stake to earn rewards, as well as receiving a profit for providing the service.


### Operating a stake pool

As a stake pool operator for Cardano, you will typically have the following abilities:
- operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano Jormungandr node continuously
- a commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
- system operation skills
- server administration skills (operational and maintenance).
- experience of development and operations (DevOps) would be very useful

Basic Nix skills are beneficial, but not required. We provide Nix scripts for ease of use, but you should be able to start a node and connect to the testnet without using these scripts.
