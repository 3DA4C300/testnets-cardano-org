## Mantis Client

The Mantis client creates the blockchain records in conjunction with the KEVM itself. This node is the base node from which the chain records are created.

By default, the blockchain and all other files that are created by the Mantis node are stored in the userâ€™s home folder under a sub folder called .mantis. This setting is found in the storage.conf file.
