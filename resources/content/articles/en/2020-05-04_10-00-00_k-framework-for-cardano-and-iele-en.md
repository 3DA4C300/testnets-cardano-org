## K framework for Cardano and IELE

<!-- embed youtube/Hq-hvaD6NSA -->

In this video, Grigore Rosu describes his research and work with IOHK since June 2017 to develop technology based on formal semantics for Cardano, including a virtual machine. Grigore is professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and chief executive of the start-up company, Runtime Verification.

The K framework has been developed by Grigore and Runtime Verification over 15 years. It is used in mission-critical applications â€“ this is software that cannot afford to fail. To this end, Runtime Verification has worked with companies including Nasa, Boeing, and Toyota. His collaboration with IOHK began after he was contacted by Charles Hoskinson. The IOHK chief executive had spotted that the software vulnerabilities that had resulted in many hacks on blockchains and the draining of cryptocurrencies worth hundreds of millions of dollars, could have been prevented using the formal methods developed by Runtime Verification.
