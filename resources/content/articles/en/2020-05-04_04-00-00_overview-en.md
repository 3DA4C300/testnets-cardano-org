## Overview

The Incentivized Testnet (ITN), was our first Shelley-based testnet, offering an environment where ada users and developers could experiment with stake pools and help build up a collection of pools on Cardano. 

By offering real ada rewards, it helped to test incentivization in a ‘real-world’ context, and gave ada holders a chance to earn rewards while testing the stake delegation experience. It also gave stake pool operators the opportunity to establish their pools.

The ITN was a significant success, marking the very first steps towards Cardano’s decentralization.
The actual rewards have now ceased. However, the network itself remains up and running – supported voluntarily by the stake pool community – so we’re keeping this site live. 

Please note, some of the content on this site is no longer relevant or accurate, but has been kept live for reference purposes.
