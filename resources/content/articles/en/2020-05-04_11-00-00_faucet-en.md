## What is the KEVM Faucet?

The faucet is a component that provides test tokens, or ether, to development users so that they can test their smart contract processes on the **KEVM** and **IELE** testnets. It essentially drip feeds the tokens to users so that they have a source of tokens for testing purposes. These test tokens enable testnet users to play with and test the execution of their smart contract on the testnet.
