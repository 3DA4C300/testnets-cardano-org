Cardano is constantly looking to expand its technological reach by creating novel avenues of cooperation. We are now reaching out to the Solidity/Ethereum community to build a compatible and interoperable platform to use their native code. Such framework, when implemented, will create a permanent bridge that will enable developers in both sides to work seamlessly in both ecosystems, now and into the future.

To this end, we are restarting the K Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) program. The EVM runs within the K Framework, a semantics platform used to create formally-verified programming languages and VMs.

K enables developers to define or implement the formal semantics of a programming language in an intuitive and modular way. K also generates an executable, 'correct by construction VM' from its formal specification, which is fast and powerful enough to run real programs and smart contracts. Long term, we want to build a K environment where we can just 'plug-and-play' new VMs
