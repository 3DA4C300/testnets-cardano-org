## Cardano testnet introduction

The rollout of Shelley sees the release of the third iteration of the testnet, which introduces stake delegation on a hybrid Byron/Shelley network designed to replicate the network conditions of the Cardano mainnet during the transition to Shelley. A new version of the Daedalus wallet has also been written to be used specifically with the third iteration of the testnet.

The testnet is designed to prove new Shelley technologies in a controlled environment. The experience, data, and feedback gathered so far during the rollout has contributed directly to the mainnet release of Shelley.


### Getting involved

To maximize the value of this testnet, all you have to do is get involved. Running a node, delegating stake, or setting up and maintaining a stake pool - all of these activities will test the network and add to the quality of the final Shelley implementation. Most importantly, whatever your experience with the testnet, we want your feedback. Let us know about bugs, usability issues, and potential improvements by raising an issue in the [Cardano node GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). 

This community-driven feedback is invaluable and will ensure that the mainnet Shelley era is the best it can be. We will also be highlighting the best community-created resources and information about the testnet on our community content page.
