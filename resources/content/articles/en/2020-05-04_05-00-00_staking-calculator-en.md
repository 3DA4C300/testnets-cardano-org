## Staking Calculator

__The rewards predicted by this calculator are only an estimate.__ The actual amount of ada received in rewards may vary, and will depend on a number of factors, including stake pool performance, which is the number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the number it was expected to produce. Changes to network parameters may also affect rewards, as IOHK adjusts the network configuration as part of the testing process.

The annualized equivalent returns given by this calculator assume that stake is delegated to the same stake pool for a 365-day period (although the Incentivized Testnet itself will not actually run that long), and that stake pool performance is consistent over that timeframe. IOHK accepts no responsibility for any discrepancy between estimated and actual rewards, __this calculator is provided for guidance only.__
