## Staking Calculator

__The rewards predicted by this calculator are only an estimate.__ The actual amount of ada received in rewards may vary, and will depend on a number of factors, including actual stake pool performance, which is the number of blocks a stake pool is observed to produce in a given epoch versus the number it was expected to produce. Changes to network parameters may also affect rewards.

The annualized equivalent returns given by this calculator assume that stake is delegated to the same stake pool for a 365-day period, and that stake pool performance and other settings are consistent over that timeframe. IOHK accepts no responsibility for any discrepancy between estimated and actual rewards, __this calculator is provided for guidance only.__
