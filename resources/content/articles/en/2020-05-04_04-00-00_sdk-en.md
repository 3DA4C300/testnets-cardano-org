## SDK

A JavaScript software development kit (SDK) is available for advanced users who want to build smart applications that can interact with the node, such as a faucet application or blockchain explorer. This SDK is compiled using WebAssembly and has a direct link between the code and JavaScript. We have provided a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBXt3XdPPe8) and [instructions](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036383254) to help with building your apps. We encourage you to use this kit and look forward to hearing your feedback.
