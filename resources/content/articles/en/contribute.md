## Contributing to the Cardano community

The efforts and contributions of the Cardano community are essential to the growth and improvement of the Shelley Haskell testnet. We encourage you to get actively involved and become a member of this community. If you have new ideas to share, or find issues or bugs while using the testnet, please submit a pull request in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node).

The Cardano community is privileged to have committed members of our [Ambassadors Program](https://www.cardano.org/ambassadors/en/about-cardano-ambassadors/) which was established in 2018, and aims to drive the adoption of Cardano, promote awareness, and educate the wider community. If you would like to join this program, please send us an [email](community@cardanofoundation.org).
