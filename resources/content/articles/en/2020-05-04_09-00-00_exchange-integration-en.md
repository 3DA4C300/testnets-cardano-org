## Exchange integration

Major exchanges interact regularly with the Cardano blockchain to offer hosted wallets to their customers so that they can deposit and withdraw ada for trading purposes.

We encourage exchanges to use this Cardano Byron testnet as a production-like environment to try out the features of the blockchain. This integration is made possible by the [Cardano API](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010928513-Getting-Started-with-Cardano-Node-API) and connect scripts, which provide the communication point for exchanges.  

We can provide assistance with building and running your hosted wallets. Please contact our Technical Support Desk using the Support button at the bottom-right of your screen for instructions on how to do this or to communicate any issues you find as part of your integration testing.
