## Jorvote

Recently an announcement was published about extending the ITN network. In this article we explained that we wanted to poll ADA holders of the ITN to decide the course of action to take. In order to participate in the vote we have created a simple application to make this activity more straightforward. 

After downloading the application you will be presented with the proposal you are to vote on in the UI display. 

In order to vote you need to enter your ITN wallet mnemonics which will restore your reward account.

A progress bar will turn green and the reward account value will appear when the retrieval has been completed successfully... You will then be able to vote.

Please note that our voting mechanism takes into account the stake casted not the number of votes casted.

There are three options to vote:

* **Yes**: Vote for the proposal
* **No**: Vote against the proposal
* **Blank**: Vote to abstain (neither counted as a yes or no)

Pick the value you want according to your preferences

You will know that your vote has been casted successfully when you receive an acknowledgement message and confirmation can be seen in the explorer.
