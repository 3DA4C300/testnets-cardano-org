__**VOTING HAS NOW ENDED AND JORVOTE WILL NO LONGER ENABLE VOTING PARTICIPATION**__

Thank you for taking part in the first round of the recent rewards extension vote. While the community voted to extend the ITN, the required participation rate was not met so the procedure will not continue.

A significant number of stake pools has however elected to maintain the ITN for a while longer, without rewards. We shall continue the community conversation over the weeks ahead as we scope out any future plans for the ITN. Thanks very much for all your contributions.
