## Testnet introduction

The Cardano Byron testnet is based on the code from the first development phase of the Cardano blockchain, offering the same functionality, integration capabilities and properties. Cardano users – such as exchanges, developers and the wider community – can test new features in this production-like environment off the main blockchain. The testnet is hosted on a virtual machine and uses test tokens so users do not have to consume real Ada when testing features.

We encourage you to use the Cardano testnet and look forward to hearing your feedback.
