    ## The Shelley testnet has begun

    ### Cardano is a groundbreaking proof-of-stake blockchain and home to the ada cryptocurrency. The Cardano testnets are at the bleeding edge of the network's development, using the power of our community to iterate and improve.

    The Shelley testnet is the final step before Shelley functionality, including stake pools, stake delegation, and decentralization, is rolled out to the Cardano mainnet. We're currently running an invitation-only beta, but the public phase is coming soon.
