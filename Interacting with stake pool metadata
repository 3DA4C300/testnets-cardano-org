Stake pool operators should follow these steps to register their stake pool’s metadata:

1. Build a JSON file for the stake pool metadata:
{
  "name": "mypool",
  "description": "My stake pool",
  "ticker": "POOL1",
  "homepage": "https://mystakepool.com"
}

Note: The metadata must be hosted in a URL that is maintained by the stake pool operator. This could be their own personal website, a GitHub raw gist file, etc. The URL cannot be longer than 64 bytes long.

2. Use the node CLI to register or re-register the stake pool on the blockchain

The registration information must include:

Relay information
Metadata URL
Metadata hash
Cost parameters

cardano-cli shelley stake-pool registration-certificate
   --metadata-url  https://mystakepool.com/mypool.json  \  
   --metadata-hash \ 
f97a632341f642f5ac1e15bd182d0c9599c3767230aa9bfb48b120f1c30538eb \  
   --pool-relay-port 3001 --pool-relay-ipv4 76.54.23.45 \
   ...
   
3. Obtain the stake pool ID
 
 Use this code to obtain the stake pool id and obtain all the information required to register the pool in the SMASH database:
 
 cardano-cli shelley stake-pool id --verification-key-file pool.vkey
> <poolid>

Note: You can check if the on-chain registration was succeeded by using this code:

cardano-cli shelley query ledger-state --testnet-magic 42 
  | jq '._delegationState._pstate._pParams.<poolid>'
  
4.Submit a PR [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ops/blob/master/topologies/ff-peers.nix) to add your pool's data.
  
  Note that you will need to provide your IP address or host name, and port.

{
   operator = “name”;
   poolId = “<poolid>”;
   metadataUrl = “https://yourpool.com/pool.json”
   meatadataHash = “yourpoolhash”;
   addr = “relay.kevinspool.org”;
   port = 3001;
}

Important: Registering your IP address with IOHK will make it “public”, so please follow good security practices by running firewalls and other online security methods.
